It's a bug on the ionic CLI. It's been fixed, but not released yet. https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor/issues/1453

As workaround you can remove the --capacitor option when creating the project, and then do the integration manually like this:

npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli

npx cap init

And let Ionic know you did the integration by adding this to the ionic.config.json

"integrations": {
    "capacitor": {}
},
